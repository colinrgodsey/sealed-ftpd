# 4. FTP Server Core

Implement the basic FTP server, including handling connections, commands, and responses.

**Specific Implementation Details:**
*   Implement a **No Authentication** driver (accept any username/password).
*   Configure the server for **Passive Mode** support (defining a port range).

## Testing

Unit tests will be written to verify that the FTP server can handle basic connections, commands, and responses correctly, including anonymous/any-auth login.
