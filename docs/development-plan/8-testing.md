# 8. Testing Strategy

While unit tests are written as part of each development step, a dedicated testing phase is crucial to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Integration Testing

Integration tests will be written to verify that the different parts of the application (FTP server, VFS, database) work together as expected.

## End-to-End Testing

The application will be manually and automatically tested using a real FTP client to ensure that it behaves like a standard FTP server. This will involve connecting to the server, transferring files, and performing various other FTP operations.
