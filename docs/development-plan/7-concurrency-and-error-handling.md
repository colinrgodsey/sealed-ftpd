# 7. Concurrency and Error Handling

Ensure the server is robust, handles concurrent connections gracefully using goroutines, and has proper error handling.

## Testing

Tests will be written to verify that the server can handle multiple concurrent connections without race conditions or deadlocks. Tests will also be written to ensure that errors are handled gracefully and do not cause the server to crash.
