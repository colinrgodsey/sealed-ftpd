# 9. Logging and Configuration

Add logging to monitor server activity and a configuration file for settings like host, port, etc.

## Testing

Tests will be written to verify that logging works as expected and that the server can be configured correctly through the configuration file. For example, tests will check that changing the port in the configuration file results in the server listening on the new port.
